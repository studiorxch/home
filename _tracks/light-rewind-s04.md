title: Light Rewind S04
permalink: /tracks/light-rewind-s04/
description: 'Warm, dusty analog keys and muted drum loops set a laid-back lo-fi groove. Vinyl crackle and subtle tape warble weave beneath mellow guitar riffs and lush synth pads, while soulful electric piano enriches the texture. A hazy blend of nostalgia that bends lo-fi through classical poise, rock grit, and country warmth.'
