# Lo-Fi Stranger Vibes: A Day and Night in Hawkins


**Published:** 2025-05-26

<p>We just wrapped a 2HR ambient lo-fi session inspired by the world of Stranger Things. The result? <em>Stranger Vibes</em> â€” our longest mix yet and our weirdest.</p>
<p>This isnâ€™t just spooky pads and synth lines. Itâ€™s middle school angst, walkie-talkie reverb, and the gentle hum of a bike wheel spinning after dark.</p>
<p>If you ever wished you could study in the Upside Down (but still ace the test), this mix is for you.</p>
