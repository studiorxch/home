# Corporate LoFi: We Made Max Goof Study Forever

<p>LoFi never sold out â€” but it definitely signed some contracts. We reimagined Disneyâ€™s Max Goof as the poster child for corporate chill â€” and then ran with it. What started as a quick sketch turned into a full-blown ambient satire loop. Keyboard clicks as percussion. Slack pings reverbing into the abyss. Fluorescent buzz as bassline. Max stares endlessly, studying contracts heâ€™ll never understand.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s absurd. Itâ€™s soothing. Itâ€™s very us.</p>
<p>File under: the best background track for pretending to work in the multiverse.</p>
