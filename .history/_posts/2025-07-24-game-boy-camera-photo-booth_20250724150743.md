## 💾 Analog Hearts, Digital Dreams

Weddings tend to be high-gloss. But this one leaned grayscale — powered by a 1998 Game Boy Camera, some brilliant hacking, and a love for pixelated memory. Photographer Brendan Barry crafted a custom booth that captured lo-fi portraits with that unmistakable dot-matrix warmth.

The setup? An analog rig that prints photos from 2-bit sensors, channeling retro gaming charm into slow-art intimacy.

## 🎞️ What It Felt Like

Imagine stepping into a moment and leaving with a memory that looks like early Pokémon dialogue — soft, square, and soulfully imperfect. No filters needed. Just time, tech, and a little visual poetry.

This isn’t just a wedding trend. It’s a reminder: nostalgia isn't a glitch — it’s a feature.

## 🌀 StudioRich Take

We love when lo-fi crosses formats — from music to image to lived moment. This project feels like a beat made visual. A perfect fit for StudioRich ethos.
