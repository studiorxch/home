## <img src="/assets/icons/little-heart-gesture.svg" alt="Heart icon" style="width: 1em; vertical-align: middle;" /> MCBAISE – *Cold Cuts* (feat. Muthi)
MCBAISE (aka Matthieu Bessudo, better known as *mcbess*) is back with a woozy, sun-kissed jam that retreats into nostalgic quirks tangled in slick guitar work and velvet synth textures. Inspired by ‘90s gaming-day dopamine—like finally getting that Sonic & Knuckles Mega Drive cartridge—the new single *“Cold Cuts”* channels supermarket​-checkout excitement with surreal, swaying visuals ([musicwire.popfiltr.com](https://musicwire.popfiltr.com/news/mcbaise-cold-cuts-ft-muthi?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Shot from a tilted, dreamlike vantage, the video mirrors the shift​-and​wobble energy in the track—as though you’re lying in the grass watching the world subtly misalign itself in slo​-mo ([completemusicupdate.com](https://completemusicupdate.com/approved-mcbaise/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

### <img src="/assets/icons/smile-face.svg" alt="Smile icon" style="width: 1em; vertical-align: middle;" />  Track vibe
- An infectious blend of yacht​-rock sheen, woozy funk, and psychedelic pop.
- Complex guitars flicker in and out like half​-remembered jingles; synths melt into warm backgrounds.
- Basslines stride confident and playful—anchored yet elastic in tone.
- Lyrical concept: *“Cold Cuts bottles the electric joy of being in a supermarket in the ’90s…”*—a precise, vivid metaphor for nostalgia mixed with modern surrealism.

- Self-directed by MCBAISE, the video features skewed angles, grassy landscapes, and a playful tilt on reality that echoes the music's nostalgic oddity.
- The aesthetic feels like a cross between vintage home movies and hand-drawn animation—sunlit, dreamy, fresh.
