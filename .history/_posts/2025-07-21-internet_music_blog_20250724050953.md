There was a time when “internet music” meant pixel art visuals, reverb-soaked samples, and a wink behind every waveform. From the jittery neon nostalgia of *vaporwave* to the meme-soft melancholy of *lo-fi remixes*, a whole tonal language emerged—ironic, sentimental, glitch-wrapped.

This wasn’t just music online—it was music *of* the internet.

You know them:
- Bitcrushed sax loops
- VHS hiss and soft static
- Anime clips stitched between beats
- Echoed emotion with no chorus, just vibe

The sound didn’t shout—it smirked, sighed, and circled back.

As lo-fi continues to evolve into a refined artform, it’s worth remembering its chaotic-cute, DIY, Tumblr-core roots. Tracks like *Nyan Cat* weren’t just novelty—they set the tone for a whole era of soft rebellion.

This post isn’t nostalgia—it’s a breadcrumb trail.
