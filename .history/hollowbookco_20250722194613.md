🐾 The Story
Born from a hidden corner of StudioRich, HollowBookCo is a quiet world of literary ambience, slow moods, and café after-hours. Once a maker of handcrafted hollow book safes, we’ve evolved into a digital refuge for cat companions, quiet thinkers, and those who find magic in margins.

Our bookstore cat—grey tabby, long passed—is still here in spirit. Her quiet curled presence lives on in every loop we build and every shelf we reimagine.
