<section class="about-content">

<p>strong>StudioRich</strong> is a Brooklyn-based audio-visual lab crafting emotionally charged worlds through lo-fi sound, glitch aesthetics, and offbeat storytelling.</p>

<p>From ambient haze and jungle percussion to anime-tinted memories and New York’s textured grit, StudioRich fuses audio and visuals into collectible experiences—each one a tactile glitch in the everyday.</p>

<p>Whether through animated cover loops, character-driven story arcs, or custom-coded engines that turn music curation into something tactile and strange, every release invites listeners into a world that feels handmade, human, and a little unruly.</p>
