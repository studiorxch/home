Lo-fi beginnings, glitch-rich futures.
</h1>
<p><strong>StudioRich</strong> is a Brooklyn-based audio-visual lab building immersive, emotionally driven experiences through lo-fi music, glitch design, and experimental storytelling. </p>

<p>Blending ambient textures, jungle rhythms, anime nostalgia, and NYC street grit, StudioRich fuses sound and visuals into collectible worlds. From animated cover loops and Twitch therapy streams to character systems and custom-built playlist engines, every project is designed to feel human, tactile, and a little bit rebellious.</p>
