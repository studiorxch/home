  title="About StudioRich: Origins" %}

StudioRich is a Brooklyn-based creative lab blending lo-fi music, graffiti culture, and rebellious design with a hint of kung fu spirit. Our work lives at the intersection of analog and AI—merging sound experiments, field recordings, and character-driven visual storytelling into collectible experiences.

From chill Twitch streams to raw NYC soundscapes and nostalgic merch drops, StudioRich is redefining what a street-born studio can be.
