📝 studioNotes:
Golden hour ambiance transitioning into dusk. Birds chirping in trees near the Gardens, light evening breeze along Shore Road. Occasional car pass-bys, faint ocean hum near the Promenade. Subtle conversations and laughter near benches. Veterans Memorial area had a still, reflective tone with soft foot traffic and flag rustling. Ideal for layering atmospheric lo-fi or ambient textures.
