There’s a line in the Joyzine review that stays with you:
> “It feels as if … whoever you’re with … will one day be gone.”

That feeling—scented, momentary, maybe vanishing—runs through every part of *Desperate Flower*. Welcome Strawberry has always dealt in fuzz, jangle, and psych-mess shimmer, but this record leans deeper into emotion. Each song feels like a half-memory recovered through a shoegaze filter.

- Melodic guitars soaked in reverb and feedback  
- Lo-fi drum programming with an analog soul  
- Vocal softness that feels like it’s remembering itself  
- Psychedelic shimmer with shoegaze depth

**Standout track:** "Memory Cube" — a standout on first listen and replayable in ways that loop with new layers.

For fans of: Apples in Stereo, Neutral Milk Hotel, early Deerhunter.

We’re drawn to artists who use lo-fi as language, not just filter. Welcome Strawberry has a sense of sonic time-travel—letting fragments echo, feedback bloom, and melancholy shimmer. *Desperate Flower* is perfect for slow afternoons or scent-triggered spirals.

One of those rare records that feels both handmade and haunted.
