# 🎶 Loop Leaderboard: July’s Lo‑Fi in Sound

July at StudioRich was a month of deep breaths and repeat moments. Lo‑Fi lived in the background of mornings and carried through long nights. From immersive slow‑burn loops like _Backwards Ventilation_ to nostalgic echoes like _Cassette Crush_, these tracks weren’t just played — they defined how July felt in sound.

It was a season of patience and haze, where songs carried the weight of memory as much as melody. The month began with long, lingering loops that stretched like warm air in still rooms, and closed with flashes of brightness that hinted at change. July’s Lo‑Fi was both anchor and escape — grounding rhythms on one hand, dreamlike fades on the other.

Think of this list less as a ranking and more as a constellation: each track its own star, together sketching the shape of July in sound.
