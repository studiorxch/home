# 📼 The Reading Room

### Chapter 02 — _Cassette Tapes for the Mind_

Before YouTube streams and Spotify playlists, study music often came on cassette tapes.  
In the 1990s, productivity and focus were sold in plastic shells, with labels promising _“Sharper Memory,” “Better Reading,” and even “Smarter Thinking.”_

This chapter explores the strange, fascinating world of those tapes:

- How the **Mozart Effect** hype fueled an entire industry.
- The role of **corporate culture** (Microsoft, IBM, Harvard studies) in spreading the idea.
- Why these cassettes feel like the **direct ancestors of lo-fi livestreams** today.
