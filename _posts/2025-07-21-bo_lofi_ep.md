## ðŸŒ¸ Game-Scape Meets Beat-Tape
The upcoming hand-drawn indie game *Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus* just stepped into the lo-fi lane with a gorgeous, free-to-download chillhop EP. Designed to soundtrack study sessions, reflective evenings, and soft-focus scrolls, this volume is both a standalone vibe and a teaser for the sonic identity of the game itself.

## ðŸŽ§ Listen In
This is not your usual lo-fi filler. The tracks carry weight: layered with Japanese folk textures, bell chimes, and analog grain. Itâ€™s lo-fi, but rootedâ€”drawing from the mythic energy and painterly palette of the gameâ€™s world.

Perfect for:
- Sketching new ideas
- Wandering thoughts
- Quiet game dev sprints

## ðŸŒ€ StudioRich Take
We love when visual storytelling expands into the auditory. *Bo*â€™s EP feels curated for the in-between momentsâ€”those margins in a sketchbook or pauses before sleep. The fact that it's free only deepens its charm.
