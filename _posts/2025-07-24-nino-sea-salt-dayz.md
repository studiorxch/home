There’s no drop. No buildup. Just soft looped calm. In *Sea Salt Dayz*, NINO leans into clarity — a mantra for quiet resets:
> “I choose the good. I choose peace. I choose simple.”

It’s the kind of lo-fi track that doesn’t try to move you — it tries to **settle** you.

- Mellow bedroom pop meets shoreline lo-fi
- Gentle vocals with an inner monologue feel
- Swung rhythm section, soft electric textures

Good for:
- Midday resets  
- Seaside journaling  
- Letting go of internal loops

This isn’t soft for softness’ sake — it’s intentional. *Sea Salt Dayz* is what happens when quiet becomes craft. NINO offers stillness like a friend handing you water: calm, uncomplicated, necessary.

A track to walk with, or breathe beside.
