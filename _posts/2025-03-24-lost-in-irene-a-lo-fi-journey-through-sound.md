<p><span>At </span><span><strong>StudioRich</strong></span><span>, we’re always tuning into the softest frequencies — tape hiss, rain delay echoes, the kind of static that makes your memory feel analog. This time, we’ve turned our dial to Irene, a sonic space tucked somewhere between dream and departure. The new tape dips into lo-fi melodies with vinyl warmth, wrapping listeners in a subtle, melancholic warmth. Built on field recordings and half-remembered chords, *Lost in Irene* is a kind of drift. You don’t press play — you come across it, like a forgotten signal fading in. </span></p>
