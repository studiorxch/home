description: "Part of the Streetlight Archives series, this Nightwatch entry captures a stationary sunset view from Bay Ridge’s American Veterans Memorial Pier. While the camera remains still, the surrounding city breathes — layered with ambient field recordings and original music. This is a quiet observation, not a journey. Designed for headphone immersion and late-night reflection."
