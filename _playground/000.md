  Step into the StudioRich playground where sound and style converge. The Mixtape Cardigan — moss green with its nine-row cassette motif — takes center stage in the abandoned arches of New York’s City Hall station. Paired with the rotating Jungle Mix playlist, it becomes more than clothing or music — it’s a collectible moment, carrying the echoes of the city into your collection.
